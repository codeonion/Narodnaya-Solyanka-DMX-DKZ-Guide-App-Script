He tells you to go to the Rookie Village and get medicine from the Doctor. He also gives you a few items. \n\n2. Talk to the doctor in one of the cellars in the Rookie Village. After some dialogue a glass of medicine will spawn in your inventory. Double click on it and you will be transported to a cave. \n\n3. Grab all the contents from the backpack in front of you (mini-gun, bandit exosuit, ammo, a map of the cave and other bits and pieces,  in your inventory there should be a map of the cave. You can put the map  in the pistol (top weapon) slot on your inventory screen. The map will appear on the screen when you choose the pistol slot.  The cave contains one way walls and wall sections that you can climb. You need to follow the lines on the map exactly to get to your intended destination or you might get blocked by a wall. Head to the miner (Shakhtar) located in the chamber on the lower left hand corner of the map. Once there talk to him and he will take all the stuff you got from the backpack and the artefacts. A glass of medicine will be spawned in your inventory. Double click on it to teleport back to the Rookie Village in Cordon. \n\n!Note: After rescuing Nimble ask Sidrovich about using repair kits to get a repair kit for your weapons and armor.";

(Viaduct a tunnel under the road from the village of newcomers to the bridge) \n\n2. Find the wounded bandit that spawns in the Garbage when you take the note from the dead soldier. The bandit shows up on your PDA in the garbage by the building in front of the Duty checkpoint. Take the bandits PDA. \n\n3. After that we look for a bandit called Friar who stole a PDA (Fraers PDA). Friar can appear on the quest to kill the bandit Poker given by General Voronin. (At different times Friar can be found in Dark Valley, Garbage, Agroprom or in the Agroprom underground) \n\n4. We then go to the Duty checkpoint in the Garbage and talk to Prapor (Warrant Officer). Prapor (Warrant Officer) offers to trade a broken PDA he found on a bandit (Mojito) for 10 scientific first aid kits. After giving him the first aid kits he tells you that the technicians at the bar can fix it. Talk to the barman. \n\n5. We go the barman and give him the PDA. He asks for the artifact Tears of Fire for the PDA repair. \n\n6. The Barman tells us that the PDA was accidentally destroyed by the technicians. The branch seems lost. \n\n7. To continue the quest chain we must complete a mission for Freedoms leader Lukash. To \nobtain this quest we must inform him of the rogue Duty squad led by Skull at the farm by the Freedom base. After the Duty squad is eliminated we talk to Lukash and get the quest to kill the traitor Pavlik. Follow the mission and then search the bodies. After picking up a PDA on one of the bodies (Aras corpse) we find the location of the mercenary Grey in Wild Territory. Head to his location as shown on the map. !Note: Grey will not spawn until this mission is completed. A grey circle will show his location on the PDA but he will not be there yet. !Tip: Max will not lead Freedom forces to attack the rogue Duty camp if a team member is lying wounded somewhere (usually a tower sniper). \n\n8. At the Wild Territory, near the transit point to Yantar we find a group of mercenaries. Kill Grey and search his body. From his PDA we learn about the lost expedition. From the information on the pda we also learn that Sakharov knows of the expedition. We go talk to Sakharov. \n\n9. Sakharov will only talk to us after we turn off the burner (X16) and complete the search for Fangs killer quests (below). \n\n10. Sakharov tells us we can find the Lost Expedition in lab X-10. We search lab X-10 and find two dead scientists and one barely alive. The barely alive scientist asks us to kill him. Shoot him and search his body to find a note (or it will appear in the players inventory depending on what you did with your stuff during the Le Harve robbery scene) with the transition from x-10 to the Sarcophagus. \n\n11. Go to the Begin Search For Ghost and Fangs Murderers and the Search for Ghost quests below and find Ghost to continue this quest chain. (Ghost hints that there is another way out of X-10, but where?) \n\n12. Ghost sends the player back to the bar to talk with Freeman. In the case you returned to him (quest 2 from begin search for Ghost and Fangs Murderers) he found a reference to the secret passage to the monolith (Sarcophagus) from X-10. \n\n13. Go to the Garbage, kill Tamaz and collect the plans (blueprints) for X-10 and bring them to Freeman. \n\n14. When we give the plans (blueprints) from x-10 to Freeman we learn about the way from X-10 to the sarcophagus and back. (The door to the left of the locked coded door in the room where you switched off the brain scorcher) The transition point will show up on your huds minimap. \n\n15. We go back to Ghost. If you have found the missing expedition and the way from X-10 to the Sarcophagus, we get the job to bring 10 gold chunks of meat from Chernobyl-2 . \"Tip: Take the job of collecting 10 Gold Chunks for Ghost before finishing the original Stalker SOC plot. You can use the decoder to open the door to the monolith lab to get to Chernobyl-2. Collect the gold chunks and play through the good ending. The last teleport will bring you back to Pripyat. \n\n16. We bring Ghost the gold chunks. As a reward we receive information about the transition from Chernobyl-2 to the Sarcophagus. \n\n17. Talk to Ghost again and get the task of finding the 3 parts of a Monoliths diary in Chernobyl-2. The locations will appear on your PDA map. \"Tip: The transition from the Sarcophagus to Chernobyl-2 that Ghost gave you will \nbe visible on your huds minimap when you get close to it. it's the same with the transition points of any underground level. The other transition point Chernobyl-2 to Sarcophagus can be seen on the regular map. \n\n18. Return to Ghost and give him the diaries.";
	string t_3_QuestForArkharasNotebook   = "1. Talk to Dan located at the machine yard in the Swamps. Dan is spawned after the completion of the PKM task given by the leader of Clear Sky's Boss Sviblova. Even though his map icon will show up on the PDA he will not be there until you do the PKM mission. \n\n2. Come on Agroprom (need to steal documents from the main Stalker task) \n\n3. We speak with Zahar (Bar) (incidentally you can take a quest to protect members of Dans group in Cordon) (optional?) \n\n4. Dan tells us of unusual activity in the Agroprom military base. He sends us to meet a group of stalkers led by Arkhara. We meet the group of stalkers and raid the military base and take an unadjusted psi-helmet. We deliver the device to Dan. \"Tip: You can keep the Agroprom military trader alive during a daytime attack on the Military base by stealing the psi-helmet, then sleep till its night time (the trader will disappears from under the tower at night), then follow Arkharas group to the Agroprom train tunnel from the Military base. Follow Arkharas group until they reach the tunnel. When the trader respawns in the daytime he will be safe. \n\n5. Speak with Arkhara to get the job to retrieve his notebook. \n\n6. In the Agroprom underground we find the corpse and loot Arkharas notepad. \n\n7. We give the notepad to Argali (we give it to Arkhara). Next we get the job to bring a laptop to Arkhara but we need to get a psi-helmet from Dan. So go see Dan. \n\n8. We talk to Dan and get a job to retrieve a scientists flash drive (flash card) from lab X-18 in the Dark Valley. \"Read Note: You most likely have retrieved the flash card on an earlier mission. Look in your inventory for a flash drive currently called: Flash Card of Scientists. \n\n9. Give the flash drive to Dan and he gives us a psi-helmet which is identical to the one that Sakharov gives us. \n\n10. Go to Radar and get Arkharas notebook (it s a laptop computer). A grey map circle will appear on the map of Radar to help you find it. \n\n11. Bring the laptop to Yakut who is in the Military Warehouses at the Loner camp across from the entrance to the Freedom base.\n";
	string t_4_BeginSearchForGhostandFangsMurderers  = "0. Talk to Freeman in the bar. Freeman gives us the mission to return his pistol (desert eagle) from Wild Territory. \n\n1. After returning his pistol talk to Freeman again. He gives us the task of getting his case of documents back from the mercenary Dzhejms (James/Jameson?) in Wild Territory. Find Dzhejms (James/Jameson?) in Wild Territory and talk to him. He doesn't want to give \nFreemans case back and attacks us. Kill him and the other spawned mercenaries and take the case to Freeman. \n\n2. Go to Sakharov and he will give us the quest to find Ghosts PDA from X-16. Kruglov also gives us an assignment to recover a decoder from x-16 at the same location. May as well do them both at the same time. \n\n3. Next we talk to Kruglov (Or his replacement Semenov) about Ghost. He gives us the quest to find Ghosts diary. Location is marked on PDA. Find Ghosts diary in Agroprom and bring it to Kruglov. Kruglov hints that we should speak to the bartender.  \n\n4. We speak to the bartender. In exchange for information he requests you to bring him a Simbion artefact. Bring it.";
	string t_5_ThesearchforFangsKillerl  = "7. Talk to the Duty leader General Voronin to get the task of retrieving the crazy stalkers flash drive. \n\n8. We kill the crazy stalker who lives in a swamp in the Army Warehouses. Take the flash drive from the corpse and return t to Voronin.(Freedoms Max can also give a quest for the crazy stalkers flash drive. You can accept both missions just buy the flash drive back from Max) (One more thing, the Swamp is very active, and creatures can often kill the crazy stalker before the mission and his body may disappear. To avoid this kill the stalker as soon as possible.) \n\n9. Next head to the bar and speak to the informant (Snitch). For information he requests the PDA of a mercenary called Tirana. \n\n10. Snitch sends us to Dan in the Swamps to recover the PDA. Dan is spawned during the PKM mission given by Clear Sky Leader Sviblova. Even though his map icon will show up he will not be there yet. So we need to start that quest chain. \"Tip:  A transition to the swamps from Cordon is spawned when you talk to Fanatic about helping to defend the Rookie Village from mercenaries after escaping lab x-18 in the Dark Valley. \n\n11. We give Tiranas PDA to Snitch. He tells us about the mercenary Le Havre. \n\n12. We speak to Snitch and learn that Freedom is in contact with the mercenary Le Havre. \n\n13. We go and speak to Le Havre at the Freedom base. He gives us a quest to kill a mercenary called Bolt and bring him Bolts PDA. \n\n14. Again, speak with Le Havre and accept the task of retrieving information from a dead Monolith informant in X-10. \n\n15. In x-10 we find the corpse of the Monolith and take the documents. Bring the documents to Le Havre. \n\n16. Head to the bar and talk with Freeman next. Talking with Freeman in the bar we learn about a gathering of mercenaries in the Dark Valley, He asks us to retrieve a flash drive from one of the mercenaries. A map icon will appear on your PDA at the factory where the entrance to lab X-18 is located. \n\n17. Go to the area and meet the mercenaries and bring the flash drive to Freeman. \n\n18. After giving the flash drive to Freeman we go and speak to Le Havre again. Le Havre robs and drugs the player. (Don't bring a lot of stuff. Go to Le Havre light. I usually throw \noff everything beforehand in the hatch on the edge of the minefield, left of the entrance of the Freedom base. Drop your repair box, gun and ammo on the floor before talking to Le Havre the first time. Then pick it up when you wake up.) \"Tip: Do this task before picking up the door decoder device in Pripyat or else you may have to add it to the trader files because it disappears. Other items may disappear also (knife, some flash drives, etc. .). You may also lose your repair kit. If you lose it talk to the barman and pay him 10 jellyfish artefacts to get it back. It will contain all your previous armor/weapon repair kits. \n\n19. Again, talk with Le Havre, he becomes an enemy, and with a clear conscience kill him and all his associates. \n\n20. Speak to Yakut at the Loner camp across from the Freedom base entrance. He tells us a box was dragged from the Freedom base recently (the players stuff). \n\n21. Go to the mercenary outpost and kill all the mercenaries and retrieve the box. \n\n22. Deliver the box to Yakut and get your stuff back. (Warning some items may disappear such as the decoder for the Sarcophagus. If this happens you will need to add it to the trader files to get another one.)";
	string t_6_TheSearchforGhost  = "7. Talking with Kruglov. To decrypt the diary he needs a working computer. He sends us to Arkhara. Arkhara will spawn during the quest to retrieve a device (not adjusted psi- helmet) from the Agroprom Military base given by Dan. An icon displaying his location can be seen but he will not be there yet. So you must do that quest first (quest is in the section Quest for Arkharas Notebook). \n\n8. Talking with Arkhara he tells us we can find a computer in lab X-18. \n\n9. We find the computer in X-18 and bring it to Kruglov. \n\n10.Kruglov sends the player to Yakut who is at the Loner camp across from the entrance to the Freedom base. (Dialogue will appear only after you complete the search for Fangs killers missions and turning off the burner in the Yantar lab X-16). !Note: When returning to the bar from lab x-18 in the Dark Valley your PDA will start to malfunction. Your HUD will disappear, you will not be able to access your inventory screen or talk to people in certain areas. Head to the bar and talk to the barman. He will tell you to talk to the technicians in the back room of the bar. Bribe Garik (the guard blocking the doorway to the back room) to get past him. Talk to the technician called Associate. He offers to repair your pda and sends you to pay the barman. Pay the barman and go back to the technician to pick up your PDA. A message will appear after a few minutes that your PDA is working. \n\n11.. We receive (or have already received) an SMS from Ghost. 12. We go to Yakut and ask him where to find Ghost. He sends the player into the Agroprom Underground.. \n\n13. In the basement of the Agricultural industry we stumble into an ambush, but obviously not waiting for us. (Not sure if the completion trigger for this mission is killing the Avengers or exiting the other other side of the Agroprom Underground) \n14. We go back to Yakut. He offers a second location where Ghost might be. He sends the \nplayer to Radar. Ghosts location is marked on the map (entrance way to lab X-10). Go there and then we find Ghost! \n\n15. Ghost sends the player to the Swamps to meet Owls group and to try to kill Beast (Animal). Owls group will show up on the map of the swamps when the mission is accepted. Beast is located in the Northern Farmstead (upper NE corner of the swamps near an exit to Cordon). Kill one of Beasts (animals) henchman and take his flash drive. \n\n16. Along the way, if Owl is killed, search his corpse and get a tip on his cache in the X-10. In his cache we find a note from owl to ghost. (The cache can be found with or without Owl dying. You just need to find it.) \n\n17. Go back to Ghost and bring him Beasts (Animals) flash drive.\n\n18. Then Ghost sends us to the Cordon Military Checkpoint. Kill the Military and Avengers and take the documents from the lead Avenger Beast (Animal). \"Tip: Killing the lead Avenger with the documents may cause the helicopters to leave. You may also want to protect the Rookie Village from a counter attack to keep Fanatic alive.\n\n19. Bring the documents to Ghost. At the end of the New quests plot, but did not finish quests Solyanka.";
	string t_7_ClearSkyQuests  = "Warning In the version of 3.08 s not recommended to go to the marshlands to the quests for Agroprom main plot (pick up the registration period or the Mojito). Go to the marshlands in the version from 3.08 Solyanka obtain a Shustry (you must select the des red line of dialogue), with the addition of 8.08 and after-the transitions given by Fanatic after the quest to protect the Rookie Village from mercenaries. The transition is displayed on the PDA map and situated just south of the Rookie Village. \n\n\"Tip:  Fanatic awards the transition to the Swamp from Cordon when you finish the job of protecting the Rookie Village from the Mercenary attack on the way back from lab x-18 n the Dark Valley. \n\n1. At the entrance to the swamps is the Village Clerk. He gives the task to rescue a friend from the captivity of the bandits. Go to the Church and kill all the bandits and rescue the captive Sahat. \n\n2. Return to the Village Clerk and tell him about the rescue. He will then tell us about the teleport to the Clear Sky base. \n\n3. We go to the base and meet 3 characters who give us quests-Basil, Cold, and the leader of Clear Sky Chistonebovtsev Sviblova. \n\n4. Basils Task-find the healing salve. \n\n4.1. Go to the Kalmyks hut (the pump station) - a place marked on the map in a grey circle. In the hut on the floor is a backpack with a grenade in it. Take the grenade and it explodes (with player should be very good protection from the explosion - Artefact + suit). After the explosion Kalmyk appears. \n\n4.2. We speak to Kalmyk who asks us to retrieve a container from a backpack. The location of the container is marked on the map in a circle. \n\n4.3. Go to the backpack and take the container. The backpack is surrounded by teleports. \nThe teleport around the backpack has at least 1 way through. It may be very narrow (+ / - two feet away and it does not work) you need to find the route through. It seems that the entrance way is set randomly. Be persevering and approach the backpack from a different direction each time. \n\n4.4.Bring the container to Kalmyk and he will then offer containers of ointment in exchange for bottles of Vodka. Trade for 3 jars of ointment and bring them to Basil. \n\n4.5. After giving Basil the ointment he will be able to upgrade and repair some suits. \n\n5. Cold gives us a simple task to tag a unique pseudogiant in Agroprom. The location is marked on the map in the PDA. The pseudogiant runs in a ravine north-east of the Agroprom complex where adrenaline the trader is (from the entrance of the dump immediately to the right along the fence). We must shoot the pseudogiant with a dart from the special iglomyot rifle Cold gives us. \n5.1. We return the iglomyot rifle to Cold and tell him that we tagged the pseudogiant. Quests Sviblova are key to the further passage of the plot, including to open the passage to the new location (Limansk et seq.) \n\n6. We speak with Clear Sky leader Sviblovo to obtain a task to bring the brain of a unique controller. The location where the controllers spawn is marked on the map. Kill the controllers and search their bodies to obtain a controller brain. \n\n7. Give the brain to Sviblovo and have the opportunity to exchange parts of unique monsters for weapons. \n\n8. Talk to Sviblovo again to get the task to steal a PKM from the bandits. He sends you to meet a scout called Kashcheyev near the Machine Yard. Kashcheyevs location is marked on the PDA. Go and talk to Kashcheyev right away. Otherwise he could die in a fight against bandits or perish in an anomaly. \n\n9. Talk to Kashcheyev to get instructions. \n\n10. We go to the bandits location and from the tank climb onto the roof. Climb down and collect the PKM from the backpack. Before taking PKM bandits should not see the player. Otherwise the quest fails. \n\n11. When the player takes the PKM from the backpack a group of Hunters led by Dan are spawned. They help to fend off the bandits. Now you can attack the bandits. After the bandits are killed you can speak with Dan. But more on that later. \n\n12. Bring the PKM to Sviblovo to obtain a new task - to verify an arms transaction between Clear Sky and a group of Mercenaries. \n\n13. We go to Cordon to the factory by the train bridge. (If you took the mission to protect the Hunters given by Zahar at the bar area they will still be there during this mission and will help during the fight.) (the PDA job misprint that will supposedly Freebie on the farm). To perform the job you need to fulfil two conditions: - The mercenaries must not have seen the player before the call for help - After the call for help and the mercenaries are killed both \"Freebie\" (Muff?) and his friend must be alive. To complete the quest you need to hide in the factory so that you can conveniently quickly jump out and begin to kill the mercenaries. I hid behind the little slack. After his cry there will be a few seconds where the mercenaries stand like statues - during this time you have time to kill at least 2. Muff and his friend help kill the remaining mercenaries. \n\n\n14. Go to Sviblovo and report back on the implementation of the task.";
	string t_8_KostyaQuestsSearchForTheBlackDoctor  = "1. We speak to Dan. We get the job to talk to Cat. Cats location is marked on the PDA. \n\n2. We go to Cat. He asks us to accompany him to the burnt-out village to search the corpse of a Monolith soldier. Directly behind Cat in the ruins in the centre of increased radiation is the corpse to which you want to get. The player should have very good protection against radiation. \n\n3. Search the corpse of Monolith. Take the map and give it to Cat. \n\n4. Escort Cat to the teleport to Clear Sky base. We go to Cat located at Colds bar in the Clear Sky base. We are told to talk to the communications officer in the communications room. \"Note: You may have to leave the Swamp map and come back for Cat to spawn at the Clear Sky Bar \n\n5. We speak to a randomly named Clear Sky npc located n the building next to where the Clear Sky leader resides. He stands n the room with all the electronic stuff in it. He asks for a TV. \n\n6. We go to Cordon. Take away the TV located near Akim and bring it to the Clear Sky npc. In return we obtain information about possible locations of the Monolith (marked with circles on the map). \n\n7. Search the locations to find the Monolith. Find them and kill them. Pick up a notebook from one of the corpses. \n\n8. We give the notebook to Cat who agrees to a follow-up meeting at the bar. \n\n9. In reality, Cat may appear in 2 places, directly in the bar or in the Army Warehouses in the Stalkers camp between the Freedom base and Bloodsucker Village. What causes the dependence of the location of the cat I do not know. We get the Cat's task to bring a drug from Kalmyk. \n\n10. We go to the Kalmyk at the pump station in the Swamps who tells us he needs ingredients, Collect (10 snork feet + Nightstar artifact) and bring them back to Kalmyk. It may take you up to 24 hours before you can pick up the medicine. \"Note: If you have not done quest 4 in Clear Sky quests Kalmyk will not have spawned yet. You will need to go to Kalmyk's hut (the pump station) - a place marked on the map in a grey circle (Kalmyks location will be shown by a white npc con). In a hut on the floor is a backpack with a grenade in it. Take the grenade and t explodes. Kalmyk will spawn and you can ask him for the medicine. \n\n11. We give the medicine to Cat. Cat sends us to get information from the Monolith in Agroprom. \n\n12. To the south west of the complex (behind the Agroprom military base) find a group of Monolith and free from their captivity Chuka and Huck. We speak with any of the pair. Accompany both to the central complex. I recommend pre-stripping the area along the way otherwise these young stalkers, like Kruglov, rush to fight with everything that moves causing the mission to fail. You may need to save/reload the game a few times because the AI gets stuck. \n\n\n13. On the territory of the central complex talk with Chuka or Huck to obtain valuable information. Go to Cat. \n\n14. Sharing information with Cat we learn about Rabinovitch and get the job to go to Skinflint (Miser) to learn about Rabinovitchs location. Go. \n\n15. Skinflint (Miser) tells us we can obtain the information that we need from a stalker called Modesty who was last seen in the Bloodsucker Village. Head there. \n\n16. In the Bloodsucker Village find Surly and Joker talking by the fire. Drink 3 bottles of Vodka with Joker and get information about Modesty. Joker tells us he last saw Modesty wandering around in the Bloodsucker Village. \n\n17. Search the Bloodsucker Village to find Modesty wounded. Give him a medkit and obtain the information about Rabinovitch. A group of Avengers appears when you heal Modesty. \n\n18. Go to Pripyat. Rabinowitz is in the apartment building with the grocery store near the hotel (Found him on the third fl0or of an apartment building located to the right of the entrance of the stadium). Talk to Rabinowitz. \n\n19. Talk to Rabinowitz and obtain information on the \"Black Doctor\". Talk to Cat at the bar. \n\n20. Report in to Cat who sends us to talk with Zahar (leader of the hunters in the bar area). \n\n21. We speak with the leader of the Hunters in the bar area Zahar and he asks us to rescue his brother Louis from a group of Avengers at the Northern Farmstead in the Swamps. If brother Louis has previously died a wounded Avenger will take his place and have his dialogue. \n\n\n22. We go to the Swamps. The base of the Avengers is the farm in the North-East corner of the Swamps near the North exit to the Cordon. We kill the Avengers and keep Brother Louis alive. Talk to him to get information about the Frenchman. \n\n23. Then go to the Freedom base and take the Dead Frenchman's PDA. The dead Frenchman's corpse was in the upper room of the Freedom headquarters. Need to loot his body fast before the npcs do. Some Avengers spawn also. Report back to the hunter leader Zahar in the Bar area. New area can be opened in step below depending on if you have completed the quests in 'The search for boxes and safes of the Mysterious Stalker', \"Continued search for a Mysterious Stalker\" and have met Fang : Red Forest and Limansk Other quests I have done up to this point in case they might be necessary: Search for the Lost Expedition, Begin Search for Ghost and Fangs Murderers, Search for Fangs Killer, The Search for Ghost, Clear Sky Quests 6-14, Quests Fang (Varlab, Red Forest) 1-26 and of course Quests Kostya Search For The Black Doctor 1-23 \n\n24. If you have met the requirements for this quest to continue a couple new ways (transitions) will appear. Talk with Fang and he will have some new dialogue options. It is possible that part described on quests and is not required for passage of the plot, but I have not tested the relationship between them. The poet describes in the same order as the passage itself. \n\n25. After completing all Fang Quests go to Limansk. In one of the buildings we find a group of Freedom soldiers headed by Bormann. Talk to Bormann (I found him outside patrolling the street) and get the task to destroy the Monolith sniper. \n\n\n26. Go to the construction site and kill all NPC's along the way including the sniper. An SMS message comes from Clear sky leader Sviblova. He wants to meet with you. \n\n27. Go to Bormann and tell him you killed the sniper. Get a new task to find the Monoliths \"silencer\" (signal dampening/jamming device) and bring it to Skinflint (Miser). The quest item may be picked up by an NPC. Check the bodies of all NPC's if the \"silencer\" is not found. \"Note: The only way out of Limansk at this point in the plot seems to be to ATP. If you haven't done the Adrenaline quests you will have to go to Kalinins camp in ATP and do some quests to get the exit to the Garbage. The quests would be defend Kalinins camp from bandits and kill their leader. Then find some artifacts to get the exit to the Garbage from ATP. \n\n28. Give Skinflint (Miser) the \"silencer\" and wait 5 hours. Take the \"silencer\" from Skinflint (Miser) and put it back at the location (drop it on the ground from your inventory screen) where you found it at the construction site. Then report back to Bormann. \n\n29. We go to Clear Sky leader Sviblovo at the Clear Sky base in the Swamps. We get the job to find out what happened to a courier in Radar. \n\n30. In Radar we find the Courier next to Ghost. It is recommended that you bring lots of first aid kits and artefacts that restore health for when you take the case from the courier. \n\n31. Take the case from the Courier and bring it to Sakharov. \n\n32. Before giving the suitcase to Sakharov and falling asleep you may want to eat. When you wake up talk to Sakharov to get a reward and return to Sviblovo. \n\n33. Talk to Sviblovo and get the teleport deactivator device (currently called: Aligner of Anomalies, it looks like an anomaly detector) . New area can be opened in step below: Hospital \n\n34. Go to Limansk. Deactivate the teleport at the construction site by dropping the teleport deactivator device (Annihilator of Anomalies) into the teleport from your inventory screen. The teleport will disappear and you can pass. We pass to the North and go to the Hospital. \n\n35. Near the entrance to the Hospital is Cat and group of Loners. Talk to him and then fight your way through the Hospital. \n\n36. At the Northern exit of the Hospital we encounter the Black Doctor. Talk to him and learn a lot of new information. He tells us the lost Zone Bosses daughter has taken an important artifact and that they are looking for her also. At the end of the conversation you fall asleep. \n\n37. Wake up and go into the teleport at the top of the stairs and get transported back to part of the Hospital level. You will need to go through a teleportation bubble (looks like the anomaly bubble) to get to the level Cat is on. Talk to Cat then exit the Hospital through the hole you entered the Hospital in and met Cat. Head back to Limansk through the level changer and continue on another plot.

Don't be lazy fetch it. \n\nNew area can be opened in step below: Labyrinth\n\n1. We speak with the miners. We get the job to save the fugitive \"prodigal son\" (Fima Coal) and to look for a notebook taken by one of the Monolith. The transition from the Cave to the Labyrinth is spawned. \n\n2. In the Labyrinth on the upper tier of transitions in the big hall loot the notebook from one of the guards (look at the notebook in your inventory to get the door code for the cell door 208568) and save the fugitive (Fima Coal). In gratitude he gives you the transition from the Labyrinth back to the Cave. If in a fire fight the Monolith suddenly killed Fima Coal don't worry, the main thing is saving him then the quest will be complete. \n\n3. We bring Shakhtar the notepad and see that Fima Coal has returned to the Cave (even if he is killed by Monolith before then). As a reward we get a recipe for a new artifact rattles. \n\n4. On the advice of Shakhtar talk with Fima and learn from him about the mysterious box (a small fancy jewelled boxed) and safe, the transition of the Labyrinth in Yantar (Amber), as well as the need to communicate with Adrenaline. For the opportunity to learn about another transition Fima requests you to bring 10 scientific first aid kits, 10 bandages, the artifact \"Soul\" and 2 bars of soap from the Rookie Village in Cordon. \n\n5. We give Fima the items and he tells us where the transition from the Labyrinth to the new location is but not how to use it yet. Speak to Adrenaline next to continue. \n\n6. We speak with Adrenaline. He asks us to bring out of the Labyrinth the small box (cassette) and safe. We only get him the box not the safe. The quest for the safe will come from the Miners later. At the same time we get the transition to the Labyrinth with Yantar (Amber). \"Tip: Adrenaline only wants you to retrieve the box to complete this mission even though he mentions the safe. The safe is locked behind doors you don't have codes for yet. \n\n7. In the Labyrinth we find the small box (cassette, casket). In it a note with interesting and useful information. We give the box (casket, cassette) to Adrenaline. We learn that we should talk with the miners. (The box (cassette, casket) can be found during other missions in the \"Labyrinth\") \"Tip: Remember the codes or the doors from the box so you can open coded doors later. Door Codes: 434018 and 206018 \n\n8. We speak with the Miner. He talks about the need for joining Monolith to get the 3rd door code. The Miner also mentions that we should talk to the immortal Shadow of the Monolith character and that we should bring him a plasma caterpillar and a rattle artefact. We go to Sidrovich to change factions. \"Tip: Get the rattle and plasma caterpillar artefacts before getting the monolith leader amulet from Sidrovich. The amulet makes everyone your enemy except Monolith which may make it harder to go to your stashes and get stuff. \n\n9. We speak to Sidrovich. He offers us a deal. We can use an amulet from a Monolith leader (the amulet makes everyone except Monolith an enemy) which only he can remove, for him \nto remove the amulet he wants us to collect 2 repair kits from the Monolith for him. \n\n10. Go to the Labyrinth. On the way to the Labyrinth try to stay far away from neutral and friendly npcs. In the Labyrinth we find the Shadow of the Monolith character and learn about the 3rd missing code (4241) for the bunker doors. Whatever he says we must offer him the \"Plasma Caterpillar\" and \"Rattle\" and he will give us the code. The safe is in a room in the bunker. The repair kits can be bought from one of the Monolith. - do not forget to bargain with them (I killed the Monolith with the 2 repair kits (and the Monolith blocking the doorways) with a knife and he still had 2 repair kits). \n\n11. Go to Cordon and give Sidrovich the 2 Monolith repair kits and he removes the Monolith medallion. \"Note: If you have lost faction standings with any of the factions during the time you wore the medallion you can pay Sidrovich 250,000-500,000 to fix your faction standing. \n\n12. Go to the Miners and give them the safe.";

With the safe go to the upper level of the Labyrinth. Find the transition to Reconnoitred Earth and go there. In the Labyrinth to find the transition to Reconnoitred Earth goto the top level of the large room. It is almost a mirror image of the transition through which the player gets to the Labyrinth\n\n2. We speak with Astrologer and learn about some local residents. He suggests you head to the Hermits (Eremites) camp and gives you instructions how to get there. \n\n3. Talk to Hermit (Eremite) in a building at there camp. He tells you some more about a few of the characters. Accept the job to retrieve the box of weapons that fell from the helicopter. After accepting the job a \"parcel\" of medicine to give to the Gynaecologist will appear in your inventory. Complete both missions. Tip: Before getting the box of weapons talk to the Gynaecologist located in the cavern. That way you can get rid of the safe and the medicine before picking up the crate of weapons. \n\n4. Talk with the Gynaecologist (Shura) and give him the \"parcel\" of medicine and the safe to open. The Gynaecologist asks for medicine in return for opening the safe. He suggests you talk to Cyclops to get the location of the medicine. The Gynaecologist wants no one to be killed during the retrieval of the medicine. \n\n5. We speak with Cyclops. From his poem we can learn about the location of the medicine. Cyclops doesn't care if you kill anybody during the retrieval of the medicine. We learn about the transition point Garbage-> Reconnoitred Earth. \n\n6. We go to Cordon and get the Medicine. \n\n7. We return and give the medicine to Cyclops or the Gynaecologist depending on the circumstances. \n\n\n8. Next speak to Zhora Anomaly. He tells you he opened the first door of the safe and there was information about Fang. To open the second door of the safe he needs batteries (accumulators) to operate an electronic device. \n\n9. We speak with the Old Man at the entrance to the cavern. He tells the story of a fiery cave. He tells us he saw batteries there. He asks you to look for his watch in the Fiery Cave when you are there. He mentions that Hermit (Eremite) speaks to people in the Fiery Cave sometimes. \n\n10. Talk to Eremite (Hermit). He knows about the Fiery Cave and knows some of its \"inhabitants\". \n\n11. There are two entrances to the Fiery Cave. Both are difficult to see. The Fiery Cave also contains one way walls. At one entrance there is the Pilgrim. Talk to him. He promises To help with the batteries and the Old Man's watch in exchange for bringing razor blades from his cache (he takes some of the other items from his cache also). He wants you to Sneak in and take the razors without being detected by the Avengers because he fears that they will retaliate. Avengers have set up camp by his cache and he cannot go there. To Complete the mission you cannot kill any Avengers. \n\n12. Easy stealth mission. Find Pilgrims abandoned backpack and take all the items. If one Avenger is killed the mission fails. \n\n13. We give Pilgrim the stuff from his cache that he wants and he gives us the Old Man's watch. He tells us to come back in an hour and a half. \n\n14. Give the Old Man his watch and he tells you about the transitions Army Warehouses -> Reconnoitred Earth, Dark Valley -> Reconnoitred Earth. \n\n15. Again we go to Pilgrim. He has shaved and is happy to give us the batteries. SMS message comes from the Hermit (Eremite). He requests you to come to him because he has information. \n\n16. We go and talk to the Hermit (Eremite). We learn that Adrenaline is looking for us. He says that the Adrenaline needs some ultra detectors (detector hologram, holographic detector). He tells us an Ecologist, Victor Hologram (he is transparent), that the Gynaecologist has treated in the cavern by the camp can help us get an ultra detector. \n\n17. Give the batteries to Zhora Anomaly and then talk to Victor Hologram. He asks us to bring him two elite detectors and a plasma caterpillar artefact. An SMS message also comes from Adrenaline telling us that people came for the box (casket) from the Labyrinth that we gave him. \n\n18. Go to Yantar and buy the elite detectors from Sakharov. (That's the trouble with detectors! Well, if you're playing with the grades, then you should already have one elite detector. And the second can be bought from Sakharov. The elite detector shows up for sale with the same frequency as the bio radar. Personally I do not sell this device once I have found one, also you can accomplish your goal by editing the traders config files. This could be corrected in the future, but for now, I had to edit the config for trader Sakharov.) Try saving and reloading your game to replenish the traders inventory. \n\n19. We give Victor Hologram two elite detectors and a plasma caterpillar. In response he sends us to Cyclops. Cyclops gives use a riddle to find the cache with the ultra detectors \n(Holographic detector, detector holograms). \n\n20. Go to the Garbage and find the cache. There are two detectors and some other stuff in the cache. One of the detectors you can keep. It can detect the Invisible Jelly anomaly (eats your armor and stuff) and the Star anomaly as well as all the other anomalies. \n\n21. We go to Adrenaline and give him one of the ultra detectors. We find out who took the box from the Labyrinth. Two stalkers took the box. One of them was the Astrologer. The second Adrenaline didn't recognize. He looked shabby like a master who had travelled the through the zone a lot. They were also searching for the safe and the player. An SMS message comes from Gynaecologist that the safe has been opened. \n\n22. We go and talk to the Gynaecologist. In the safe was an old map of areas near Chernobyl. The Gynaecologist requests you to find a diskette (floppy disk) containing information on perfusors (a device. You will see it in the cavern eventually and can pick it up). Talk to Cyclops to get clues on how to find the diskette in a riddle. When Cyclops gives you the new riddle a transition point to the Labyrinth spawns near you in the cavern. Head to the Labyrinth. \n\n23. In the Labyrinth we find a half dead (wounded) mercenary who has the diskette with the info. It is in a room just before the teleport we used to find the box in the Labyrinth. It is easier to look for the mercenary though. Take the diskette first and then talk to the mercenary. Talk to the mercenary and get the location of some flasks in Radar (mission?). \n\n24. We give the diskette to the Gynaecologist and learn that we need flasks (bulbs) for the perfusor device. In addition, we need reagents. We need to ask the leader of the Avenger snipers in Reconnoitred Earth (Chimera) about the flasks location. But currently we are their enemies and they shoot at everything that moves in Reconnoitred Earth. Wait a bit and that issue will be resolved. Talk to Cyclops to get a verse that will lead you to the flasks (bulbs). You also receive an SMS message from an unknown stalker. He is not opposed to the player making copies of the map from the safe but he asks that the original be returned to him through the Astrologer. \n\n25. We go to the army warehouses and get the 3 flasks (bulbs). \n\n26. Bring the flasks to the Gynaecologist. He asks you to find a device nearby to deactivate the teleports blocking the Fiery Cave entrances so you can find 2 power supplies and a control IC (settles for cards (circuit boards) left by a tape recorder) from a Freedom Exosuit. In addition the Gynaecologist wants Fangs map to make copies. \n\n27. The location of the teleport deactivator device on the Reconnoitred Earth map is hinted at being at a meteorite impact site (a large crater like wide open area, some boulders, mutants and anomalies). Find the teleporter deactivator device and get into the cave through one of the entrances. (A second teleport deactivator can be found in the Fiery Cave. ) Another warning, the entrances to the Fiery Cave can have heat anomalies. Consider putting artefacts that help you resist heat damage on your belt. !Warning: points 28-29 must be done without the intermediate saves / reloading. Reloading will cause the Avengers to turn back into enemies. You will need to talk to the leader of the Avengers Chimera about the reagents. \n\n28. In the Fiery Cave we find Pilgrim. Talk to him. He has a mercenaries PDA. The Avengers and mercenaries are friends. He uses the mercenaries PDA to send an SMS message to the Avenger snipers that you are a new mercenary recruit. This allows you to \napproach the Avengers later. Rummage through the Fiery Cave and find the 2 batteries and a couple cards (circuit boards)by a tape recorder. \n\n29. We go to Chimera the head of the Avengers in Reconnoitred Earth. He has a little problem with having too many competitors. He gives us an assignment – Kill Sidrovich and bring back his head as proof. Accept the mission but don't kill Sidrovich. Instead go talk to the Gynaecologist. He has a plan. \n\n30. Give the Gynaecologist the batteries and boards found in the cave. He gives you back your original copy of Fangs Map. Inform the Gynaecologist that you need Sidrovichs head to complete a mission for Chimera. The Gynaecologist suggests you give Chimera a false head. He sends us to speak to Eagle Owl (Mlja). Eagle Owl is the Commander of a group of Hunters not far from the camp. \n\n31. Eagle Owl is helpful but needs the body of a dead controller (body weighs 80 kg) located in Radar. You must go and pick it up. \n\n32. We get the body and bring it to Eagle Owl. \n\n33. For his work he asks for 10 chimera talons and a payment of 100,000 ru. We collect the items and bring them to Eagle Owl. We get (find by the saw-horse) the head of Sidrovich. \n\n34. We go to Chimera and give him the head. He does not give us the reagents. But he does tell us that Reconnoitred Earth is where Avengers are trained. He also tells us that a daughter of one of the big bosses has gone missing in the zone (may have to rescue her later). An SMS message comes from Cyclops. He is aiming for a cache. \n\n35. We go to Cyclops. We listen to the next portion of poetic revelation and we head off on his tip. From Chimeras stash take the reagents. Note: After talking to Cyclops the Avengers become enemies again. \n\n36. Give what you found to the Gynaecologist. \n\n37. We speak with Cyclops and get the latest sighting. We can also admire the charged perfusors device. We receive an SMS message from Fang. He wants to meet. This part continues in part 1 Quests Fang (Varlab, Red Forest) below. ";

(part 36 of the Continued Search for the Mysterious Stalker)\n\n1. We receive SMS from Fang (P.36 of the branch \"continue to search for the mysterious stalker\"). Go through the upper entrance (through the swamp) of the Fiery Cave.\n\nNew area can be opened in step below: Varlab\n\n2. We speak to Fang. He tells us he is looking for the daughter of one of the Zones Bosses ? He asks us to see if she is being held in Varlab by mercenaries. We obtain the transitions from Radar to Varlab from Varlab to X16. \n\n3. Go to Radar where the transition from Radar to Varlab is marked on your map. Behind the door with the combination lock is the transition to Varlab. If you don't have the code already talk to Syak located in Radar in a building at the former Monolith base. Syak gives you the code for the locked door after you bring him tools from Sidorovich. We enter \nVarlab and find mercenaries and Monolith fighting. You can just quietly stand at the door for 10-15 minutes until the enemy has destroyed much of each other. We receive an SMS message from Fang telling us he is at the farm in the Army Warehouses where the Duty squad led by Skull was previously camped. \n\n4. Find the corpse of a mercenary called Mean Machine (his name is currently untranslated in the game). His corpse is located in the billiard room. Take the notebook from the dead mercenary. \n\n5. We go to Fang who is at the Army Warehouses on the farm where the Duty squad led by Skull was previously camped. We talk to Fang and he says we should join the mercenaries to gather information on the whereabouts of the girl. He says Lukash can help us join the mercenaries. \n\n6. We speak to Lukash and learn about the seal (signet ring) and the Monolith called the Spider. \n\n7. We go to Radar and kill Spider near the exit to the Dark Valley. We take the seal (signet ring) and become a mercenary. For further movements try to avoid contact with all factions. Especially former friends and neutral npcs after their murders you can be in a hopeless situation.\n\n\"Note: You can fix your faction relations by paying Sidrovich 250,000-500,000 if you stay enemies with a faction after you become a Loner again.\n\n8. Go to Varlab. We find Panther in the billiard room. Talk with her and get a job to find a walk-talkie. It is a timed 15 minute mission. A clock will appear in the upper right hand corner of your hud. The walkie-talkie is in a backpack. To get to the backpack you must go down a ladder underneath a stairway into a dark room which has two backpacks in it. The ladder is hidden around a corner under the stairway and you have to go under the stairway and turn right to see the hole with the ladder going down. You can also only see one of the backpack at a time in the dark room. We give Panther the walkie-talkie. We learn that we want to talk to a great guy.\n\n9. We speak to one of her body guards called Dembele. He asks us to pick up a stuffed dog from the headquarters of Lukash. We also get the transition from Varlab to Army Warehouses. Don't pick up the stuffed dog yet it will not have spawned. Talk to Panther and do her missions first. \n\n\"Note: The stuffed dog will not spawn at the Freedom base until later. Speak to Panther to get a mission.\n\n10. We talk to Panther. She gives us the task to intercept a messenger in Cordon and pick up a disc. In the PDA we can see photos in the active tasks of the place where you want to get. Carefully reach Cordon. I recommend that you get a teleport from Sakharov to immediately teleport to Cordon. We sneak up to the very top of the bridge and go to the end of the broken bridge frame as shown in the photo on the PDA. An SMS message comes from Panther when we reach the right place on the bridge. The message says that we should see the messenger coming from the direction of the Cordon Military base and that we should get the disk from him and not kill him.\n\nThe task instructions are misleading. You may need to search for the messenger with the disk. \"Important Note: A Military man named Kostylnoga has the item. He may be on the rail embankment, sometimes wearing invisible armor, and can be found on Agroprom. \nHe is currently often found in the Agroprom Loner complex where Adrenaline is. You can either sneak up (camo exosuit?)Talk to him to get the disk, wound him then talk to him or kill him. Currently all options seem to work. \n\n11.Bring the disk to Panther. We get a job to take a backpack from Lukash and she gives us an invisible exosuit. She also mentions that now would be a good time to get the stuffed dog for her bodyguard Dembele. \n\n12. Go to the Army Warehouses. Get the stuffed dog for Panthers bodyguard from a room on the second floor. Then in the locked Armoury of Freedoms Headquarters find the backpack and take the prototype armor (don't use the armor or you might damage it!). \n\n13. Go to Varlab. Give the stuffed dog to Dembele and give the prototype armor to Panther. Panther also takes back the invisible exosuit. Panther tells you a mercenary boss is coming and to be ready for a fight. He shows up and she says that you are going to have to talk to him. \n\n14. We speak to the boss. He claims we are a fraud and wants the seal (signet ring) back. We say no and he attacks us. Panther and her two bodyguards help us to kill all the mercenaries in Varlab. Panther and her bodyguards are immortal so no need to worry about them dying. \n\n15. We speak with Panther and she gives us some information. Talk to Dembele and get a reward for helping Panther. Our faction changes back to being a Loner. However if your ranking with Freedom has fallen too low due to the mission they will still attack you. You may have to go to Sidrovich and pay him 250,000 ru + to fix your Freedom faction standing. \n\n16. We go to Fang who is now in the Bar area. Found him sitting by a fire with Pilgrim. We give him some information and tell him about Panther. Fang sends us to Lukash. \n\n17. Go to Lukash and give him the seal (signet ring) of the mercenaries.\n\nIt is possible that some of the following quests are not required to complete the plot but I have not tested the relationship between them. The writer describes the order in which he played the game himself.\n\n18. We speak to Lukash he asks you to escort a group of Freedom soldiers to Varlab so they can set up a base there. An SMS message comes from Panther that they had to abandon Varlab because a large group of pseudo dogs showed up. If you have not cleaned out Radar already I recommend stripping the route to Varlab of animals and enemy npcs. \n\n19. After stripping the route to Varlab talk to Vitamins and agree to meet at Radar. \n\n20. We go to Radar and Vitamins and a group of Freedom Soldiers are at the entrance way from Army Warehouses-Radar. Talk to Vitamins and then accompany the group to the hole in the fence leading to the entrance to Varlab. Only Vitamins needs to be escorted to the fence. Talk to Vitamins at the fence then enter Varlab. \n\n21. If you have no burning desire to fight with the dogs in the lab quietly waiting until Freedom strips Varlab and then talk to Vitamins in the billiard room. \n\n22. Talk to Vitamins. He deactivates the teleport blocking the way to the secret part of Varlab and we get our reward a gold bar from Freedom. An SMS message comes from the Cyclops – He has heard some rumours and wants you to return. \n\n23. In the right elevator shaft climb the ladder up to the secret part of Varlab. To get to the secret entrance climb the ladder to the third floor. Then jump off the ladder through the elevator exit. Talk with The Idler/Lazy the Ecologist in the orange environmental suit. We \nlearn about the head Scientist Klenow. \n\n24. Find Klenow and talk to him. We get a lot of interesting information. We get a mission to bring Victor Hologram (the transparent Ecologist from the cavern in Reconnoitred Earth) to Varlab. We only need to escort him to the Army Warehouses transition point in Reconnoitred Earth though. \n\n25. Go to Reconnoitred Earth and talk to Cyclops. From him we get another tip to a hiding place. \n\n26. Talk to Victor Hologram (who has been treated and has become solid again) and escort him to the Reconnoitred Earth-Army Warehouses transition point in Reconnoitered Earth. When he gets near the transition point he will turn around and walk back a bit. It is at this point you can talk to him to finish the quest. \n\n27. Go to Varlab. Victor Hologram will appear when you enter Varlab. Talk with Klenow to complete the escort Victor Hologram task and to get a new task to bring him 10 cobblestones and a heart of the poltergeist artifact. \n\n28. We go to the Cave and pick up the Heart of the Poltergeist from the Miner. To see how to get the Heart of the Poltergeist artefact see the quest chain: How to get the Heart of the Poltergeist \n\n29. After getting the Heart of The Poltergeist artefact and the 10 cobblestones go to Klenow and give him the artefacts. \n\n30. If you do not receive referrals and job descriptions of paragraph 17 - go to the Red Forest. After entering the Red Forest near the transition we meet a group headed by Shadowman. \n\n31. Talk to Shadowman and get the task to free the bridge to Limansk from mercenaries. Kill all the mercenaries on both sides of the bridge and the mission will complete. \n\n32. Talk to Shadowman again and get the task of protecting the tower (Foresters tower: the place where the forester lives in Clear Sky) from mutants. Follow him to the Foresters tower, go to the second floor of the tower and take a shotgun and stuff from a backpack and wait for the mutants. All the mutants must die to complete the mission. Sometimes there is a wounded mutant in the bushes. \n\n31. There should be a grey circle on the PDA map. Go there and talk to the Hunters. Talk to one of the hunters and get a task to retrieve a stolen backpack. \n\n32. Go to the Swamps and talk to Cold at the Clear Sky bases bar. Get information about the location of the thief. Go to the cemetery by the Church and find the thief captured by a group of Loners. Pay 50,000 to release the thief. \n\n33. Talk to Mitka to get the backpack. Bring it to the Hunters in the Red Forest.\n\n\"Note: Shooting Mitka and the stalkers before freeing Mitka seems to lead to a different outcome. I shot them and was knocked out, then there's a cut scene woke up robbed and unable to stand straight. Then I get a message from Sidrovich (Sidor). If you wish to explore this path I would make a saved game beforehand and revert to it after finding out what happens to avoid possible game ending errors.\n\n34. We give the Hunters the backpack and they tell us to look for the backpack with the \ndocuments by the tank in the Red Forest. Go to the tank and kill a bunch of monsters. Get the documents and bring them to Fang. \n\n35. Fang gives a new task to find and rescue Dennis. Go to the mine by the Foresters tower in the Red Forest. Kill all the monsters and find Denis. Escort Denis to the gate by the Foresters tower. Then head back to Fang. \n\n\"Note: You may have to go back and forth by the rail car quite a few times to get Denis past it. Shadowman and some friendly stalkers help out during the fire fight so be careful who you shoot or you might have to replay the level because Shadowman is immortal and will attack you if you shoot his people. \n\n36.

Talk to their Chief called Kolmogorov and get the task of helping Kolmogorovs group to kill all the enemies in the village store. \n\n5. Go to the store and kill all enemies. Talk with the Kolmogorov at the store when he has reached his final position. After talking to him we get the task to help him capture a building up on the hill that has been occupied by the Military. An SMS message appears on the screen from Strelok to Panther saying he wants to meet her. \n\n6. Kill all the Military and Kolmogorov enters the house they where in and the task completes. Wait for Kolmogorov to reach his final position in the house then talk to him. He ask you and Pilgrim to search the village for more soldiers. \n\n7. Talk to Pilgrim and clear the village of the leftover military. An SMS message will come from Kolmogorov to come back to him. \n\n8. Talk to Kolmogorov. He tells you to find Panther and gives you the transition from the Old Village to Limansk. Head to the transition to Limansk in the Old Village we get an SMS message from Panther. She has had to run and is in the Swamps. Her location is displayed on the Swamp map as a grey circle. \n\n9. Go to the Swamps and meet with Panther. For those whom the grey circle map marker didn't appear- Panther is at the southern tip of a peninsula near a watch tower in the \nmiddle of the swamp map on the Western side of the Swamps. When approaching Panther an SMS message comes from Fang about the approximate coordinates of a transition from the Swamps to the Old Village and the mark appears on the PDA. \n\n10. We speak with Panther. Go to the north of where you meet Panther and find a “connoisseur” of the swamps in the centre of the grey map circle on the PDA. \n\n11. Talk to him. In exchange for the path to the Lost Village he wants you to kill the controllers and bring him 2 zombie embryos from a backpack hidden somewhere on the farm nearby. Kill the controllers and find the embryos in a backpack. -To find the embryos head to the end of the boat house and look down. In the water is a backpack with the two embryos. \n\n12. Bring the embryos to the “connoisseur” and he asks for 40,000 ru. Pay him the 40,000 ru. Go to Panther and she will follow you to the “connoisseur”. Talk to the connoisseur and he may move to a slightly different spot. I have had to wait for his dialogue to change. I am not sure what the trigger was for the dialogue to add the transition. Maybe Panther reaching a certain point past him? Then talk to him again and a transition from the Swamp to the Old Village will spawn. \n\n13. Go through the transition to the Old Village and Panther will spawn next to you. \n\n14. Lead Panther to Kolmogorov. When Panther gets close to Kolmogorov the mission will complete. Talk to Kolmogorov and get the task to defend the village from the military. \n\n15. Kill all the military. An SMS message will come from Kolmogorov telling you that the military commander has landed in another parts of the village and you need to kill him. \n\n16. Go to the low-lying part of the village. Kill the commander and the other soldiers. Then take his PDA and the mission will be complete. \n\n17. Talk to Kolmogorov. An SMS message comes from Klenow/Maples asking you to meet him at Varlab. Talk to Pilgrim and then go to Varlab. A transition to the Hospital is spawned also but seems to be unreachable? \n\n18. In Varlab we receive a succession of SMS messages about Panther and Pilgrim. These will be of interest for the development of the plot in the final edition. We now go to Klenow and talk to him. He asks us to find a portable psi antenna in Cordon. The location is marked on your PDA. Note: if the dialogue for this mission doesn't appear you may have forgotten to talk to Pilgrim at the village before leaving. Head back (he will eventually spawn) and tell to him to stay at the village. \n\n19. If the location of the portable psi-antenna doesn't show on your map – the location of the psi-antenna is the crashed truck in Cordon that was carrying the player. Take the antenna and give it to Klenow. \n\nCouncil, do not hurry to pick up the antenna when you approaching it, an honour guard appears and the Committee on the solemn meeting. As a true humble warrior of good, my HS did not wait for fanfare and bombast quickly ran next to the truck and keeping up with the honour guard and the Committee for the ceremonial welcome from afar, from the sniper. \n\n20. We bring the antenna to Klenow. \nFurther progression of the plot depends on whether you have completed all the previous plots (except Clear Sky Quests 1-5, you must do the quests given by the Clear Sky leader). \n\n20.1. If you haven't completed all the previous plots go back and complete them. \n\n20.2. If you have completed all the previous plots go and talk to Pilgrim in the Old Village. After talking to Pilgrim you will get a lot of SMS messages. The last message is from Ghost telling you to meet him at the front of the nuclear power plant at the exit from CHAES-2 (STANCIA-2). This quest chain continues below in: Generators or the elusive Astrologer ";
	string t_14_GeneratorsortheelusiveAstrologer  = "Several important observations and issues \n\n1. (Repeat) - carefully read the dialogues and incoming SMS, especially red one's. Recent additions to an increasingly large part of the plot unfolds it in the exchange of SMS, including the issuance of HS tasks and tips. \n\n2. In the story there is a small inaccuracy HS can go to the generator, without passing Limansk and hospitals, not talking with Dr. Black for the first time. Do not do it then they themselves regret. \n\n3. Even though it refers to a previous amendment, but in my latest addition to having serious problems with the first conversation with a Black Doctor did not show the desired dialogue or permanent departures were after him. Try to go to the doctor with arms or without arms, replay 10 times, but finished with the dialogue. Do not worry if at the end of the dialogue and sleep in HS disappear thin or weapons no longer an option  I have healed save / load. Hood standard key is \"+\". And be sure to visit the doctor. Scrap all the Monolith in the Hospital otherwise the dialogue will not appear. \n\n4. For those not put a patch on 20.12 for a new game, and continues with the old patches do not talk to Fang, who is on CHAES2, until then, until you get to P.31 in the description. \n\n5. I, unfortunately, on generators often do not work (not loaded) conservation workers have always been just auto-save. Struggled with this a few crooked way after a major quest, went to the location and went back, got a new auto-save. Unfortunately, the method doe's not always work  it seems that the performance of performers in quests can not leave the location. \n\n6. Very often occur departures (at any location) of this type (numbers may vary)";
	string t_15_boom  = "The reasons for these departures Arkhara not know I always helped the replay, departures are not critical.\n\nNow the actual story itself. \n\nThis part of the storyline begins after having talked to Pilgrim in the Old Village.\n\n1. From the SMS messages the player has received from Fang and Ghost we know that we must meet Ghost at CHAES-1. The location we are told to meet Ghost at is where the transition from CHAES-2 (back of the nuclear power plant) to CHAES-1 (front of the nuclear power plant) spawns you at in CHAES-1. To find the location you can go through the transition from CHAES-2 to CHAES-1. The transition is marked on the map on the PDA. \n\n\"Tip: If you haven't got the transition from CHAES-2 to CHAES-1 you can go through the x-10 transition to the Sarcophagus and there should be a letter by the wish granter that spawns the transition when you pick it up. \n\nNew area opens in step below: Generators\n\n2. At CHAES-1 meet Ghost near where the CHAES-2 to CHAES-1 transition spawns you on CHAES-1. He says he is leading us to a place of transition (dialogue is currently unreadable in my game). Follow him (if he doesn't move save/reload the game). When he stops talk to him. A new transition will appear. Go to the Generators.\n\n\"Note: The transition from CHAES-1 to generators did not appear on my map. The transition is visible on the minimap. You may have to turn the player around a bit to see it on the minimap. It's the gates near the location where Ghost stops.\n\n3. When we spawn on the Generator map Ghost is next to us. Talk to him and he will lead you. You may have to save/reload your game to make Ghost move. When Ghost stops talk to him. He tells us he needs more information about the O-consciousness base and to talk to a Senior (old person?) at a village South of your location. \n\n4. Finding the Senior is not a problem. Talk to him and either pay him 100,000 ru or perform a quest to destroy a helicopter. To do the helicopter quest you must find a helicopter flying around in the air over the Generators. You have a 10 minute time limit to do this mission. Shoot the helicopter and you will get a red SMS like message on the screen. The helicopter will fly lower and start to shoot at you. Destroy the helicopter and report back to the Senior. After paying the Senior or completing the helicopter task the Senior tells you about a scientist who managed to escape from the lab called Fritz (really Anderson). Find Fritz/Anderson. \n\n5. Fritz/Anderson is located in the cellar of the village. When you approach the guard you will get a series of SMS messages. Eventually the guard will move off to the side and you will be let down into the cellar to talk to Anderson. Talk to Anderson. \n\n6. A helicopter lands and the Black Doctor exits it. Talk to the Black Doctor. We get the task to find Boatswain. \n\n7. Go to Ghost who has arrived at the village and is probably somewhere near you. Talk to him. Ghost says he will stay and gather information on Boatswain. Go back to the Black Doctor and ask to use his helicopter. The Black Doctor lets you use the helicopter and gives you some advice. Go to the helicopter and a cut scene will play and the Swamp level will load. \n\n8. When you get on the Swamp jump over the fence to get to the regular map. Then go to the cave under the ruined railway bridge in the Northwest corner of the Swamps. People who played Clear Sky a lot probably know where the bridge and the cave are where Boatswain is. For those who didn't play Clear Sky heres a hint – there is a hole in a fence of barbed wire, not far from the bridge. Find Boatswain and talk to him. \n\n9. Exit the cave and get the job to bring Boatswain to the cemetery by the Church where a helicopter will pick him up and bring him to the Generators. Boatswain will walk to the fence by the nearby farm which had the controllers and zombies in it. He will stop. Talk to him and he will follow you. Protect him and bring him to the cemetery by the Church.\n\n\"Tip: Kill all the controllers and zombies at the farm near the cave in the Swamps before talking to Boatswain or Boatswain will die fast. Maybe clear a wide path to the cemetery \nand kill all the bandits at the church. Boatswain is good at detecting enemies far away and will stop until they are killed.\n\n10. At the cemetery the pilot tells you to kill any bandits nearby because the helicopter is unarmed. Kill all the bandits and keep Boatswain alive then enter the helicopter for another cut scene. Then you are transferred to the Generators.\n\n\"Tip: The helicopter will not land until you eliminate every Bandit sent to attack you. (find any Bandits that ran away).\n\n11. Talk to boatswain then talk to Anderson. Anderson gives us the job to find a joystick. Then talk to Ghost and get the transition to Pripyat. \n\n12. Find the joystick on the generator map. A map of possible locations of the joystick is displayed on the active tasks section of the PDA. Find the joystick. \n\n13.Talk to Anderson. Then talk to Boatswain and give him the joystick. Follow Boatswain to the edge of the psi-field protecting the base. Don't enter the boarder or you will die in 10 seconds. Waiting until Boatswain disconnects the antenna in and out of the zone. You will get a few SMS messages from Boatswain but you will need to wait for him to come back to the psi-field border. This can take quite a few minutes. You can view his location on the map because he has a white map marker. If he seems to get stuck save/reload the game. Talk with him when he reaches the psi-field border. \n\n14. Go to the ghost. Talk to him. After a lot of SMS messages talk to him again. Then you get the task to rescue Panther. Ghost will follow you as you attack the base. Some of the Black Doctors men will land in helicopters and help you kill the Monolith. We receive an SMS that the leader has entered an underground passage way and has taken the girl. Look for a small hole in the ground in the monolith base. Jump done the hole and kill the Monolith and then continue down the passage way. At the end find a helicopter taking off and Panthers body. \n\n15. Wait for the Black Doctor to land in a helicopter at Panthers corpse. Talk to the Black Doctor then talk to Ghost. Go back to the village to talk to Boatswain. \n\n16. Talk to Boatswain and then you pass out. Wake up and go to Ghost (He was still where we found Panthers body ). Ghost says he found a backpack with a note from Panther in it. The note has the code to the door on the captured Monolith base (currently:25190456). Put the letter in your pistol slot to read it. After talking to Ghost there is an exchange of SMS messages. You get a task to pick up information. \n\n17. Open the door to Varlab. There is a teleport deactivator inside. Go to the paved road in the North East quadrant of the map. We find a corpse with a document lying next to it. Pick up the note. An active exchange of SMS messages occurs. You get the task to find a cave. We leave for reconnoitred earth. \n\n\"Note: The teleport deactivator can fall down the stairs save the game before approaching the captured monolith base and reload the game if the teleport deactivator falls down the stairs.\n\n18. In reconnoitred earth search for the secret cave. The problem in fact is not that complicated. Hint - in the cave will sit a living person. When you find the cave the task will complete and you will receive an SMS message from Fang not to go into the cave. - go to Fang's headquarters in the Fiery Cave (will have to go through the underwater swamp \nentrance). Talk to him and lead him back to the cave you found. \n\n19. When we reach the cave the teleport is disabled. We climb into the cave and find the Fly (the girl). Talk to her. A helicopter flies over the cave. Leave the cave and approach Fang. The helicopter lands and Panther and another npc exit the helicopter. Talk to Panther. Then talk to Fang. \n\n20. After talking to Fang Fly will leave the cave. Eventually Fly and Fang will head to the hermits camp. Follow them there. When you get to the camp you get a new task to pick up an artifact from klenow in Varlab. Wait till Fly sits by the fire and Fang stands by the fire in the Hermits camp then talk to Fly. Fly gives you the task to retrieve her doll from a house in Radar. In your inventory a “picture” of her doll will be spawned. Put the “picture” in the pistol slot to view it. Talk to Fang. \n\n21. Go to Varlab. \n\n22. Talk to Klenow and pick up a modified heart of the poltergeist artifact (and a spiral artifact) from him. Then go to Radar and find the doll (in the house where we found the reagents for the perfusor device). Bring the doll to Fly. \n\n23. Talk to Fang who tells us to talk Voronin because he has contact with the military. Talk to Voronin. We get an active exchange of SMS messages. Go to CHAES-2 and search for the first helicopter on the roofs of the nuclear power plant. \n\n\"Note: The way you are supposed to get to the roof where the helicopter is to do the controller brains for Lukash mission and use one of the five Monolith teleports you get as a reward. A cheating way is to run and jump (20-30+ times) at the railing behind a teleport near the crashed helicopter until you end up on the other side of the invisible barrier. \n\n24. Go to the helicopter and pick up the flight recorder. There is an exchange of SMS messages. Some how from the messages we learn that we must find 2 more helicopters. Start looking for them. \n25. The second helicopter is also on the nuclear power plant roof. Go through some more teleports and then jump over the railing to land on the part the roof with the helicopter on it. When you find the helicopter a note lying next to a dead soldier will give you hints on how to get to the next helicopters location. You can pick up the note put it in the pistol slot to view it. To get to the third helicopter climb on one of the second helicopters blades and jump down onto the top of the large tanks below the second helicopter. A teleport will appear and you go through it. You will appear on the top part of a crane. Walk down the crane and jump onto the smoke stacks walkway. Walk around the walkway until you find a teleport and go through the teleport. The teleport will take you to the walkway with the crashed helicopter. Find a backpack by the crashed helicopter and take the contents (water flower artefact, 1 monolith teleport). \n\n26. Bring the flight recorder to Voronin. After giving him the flight recorder you will receive a series of SMS messages. \n\n27. Go back to reconnoitred earth and talk to Fly. You tell her what you found in the bag. Then a helicopter lands and picks her up. As the helicopter takes off a box appears below the helicopter. Go to the box and get your gifts from the military. \n\n28. Talk to Fang. A series of SMS messages comes from helicopters. Head to the swamp where the underwater entrance to the Fiery Cave is in Reconnoitred Earth. Look for Fly's \nbody and a wounded lieutenant next to her on the shoreline of the swamp. Give the lieutenant a medkit and talk to him. A couple pictures that you can view in your pistol slot will appear in your inventory. There are several SMS messages. Go to the cave where you first met Fly in order to receive another series of SMS messages. After the SMS messages you get the task to help start up the third generator. Go to the Generators. \n\n29. Go to the captured Monolith base and talk to Anderson. You get a task to disable (collect) some devices causing interference with the generators. Go to the substation near the base and enter the fence through one of the holes in the fence. There are at least two holes in the fence. Collect all the generators and bring them to Anderson. After some SMS messages to get scientists into Varlab a Freedom soldier comes up and negotiates with Sapsan. There is a lot of SMS messages. \n\n30. Then talk to Anderson and go to the paved road in the North East section of the map and kill all the Monolith. Get another SMS message and the field where all the generators are in the middle of the map. Walk around the field and when you reach the “right place” (by a small tank that looks like it holds water) you will get an SMS message. The task to start up the third generator will complete. We receive some SMS messages and Panther appears. Talk to her then go to CHAES-2 to meet Fang. His location is marked by a grey circle on the map. \n\n31. Meet with Fang on CHAES-2 (his location marked on the map). Talk to Fang and he tells you (currently the text is unfinished in my game) to go to a position on a map he gives you and wait for events to occur. The map appears in your inventory and can be viewed by putting it in the pistol slot. When you reach the spot a task complete message will appear on the screen and you will receive several SMS messages. Shoot some Monolith and you will get an SMS message from Fang saying that he was wrong and you need to come back to the meeting place. \n\n32. We ran back at full speed. Watching the catastrophe with the APC's and helicopters. We grieve for a lost friend listening to the SMS messages. \n\n33. We receive an invitation from the Black Doctor. Go to the hospital. Go down into the hole in the hospital floor where you talked to the Black Doctor. You can now open the doors in the room where you talked to him to get into the back of the hospital. When you enter the back of the hospital Panther is there. There are a lot of SMS messages. \n\n34. After quite a few SMS messages the Black doctor invites you to come up. Go through a couple teleport bubbles to get to him. Talk to the Black Doctor then talk to Panthers father who is standing next to the Black Doctor. After you finish talking to Panthers father talk to the black Doctor again. Depending on your choices during the dialogue you can get different outcomes. \n\nThe true end of the game looks like this: \n\n35. In dialogue with the Black Doctor select the dialogue to cook the modified heart of the poltergeist to make the “good luck stone” artefact. Go to the back wall closet and throw the modified Heart of the Poltergeist onto the white circle (may have to be dropped in the bubbly goo) - as usual, there is a flash and a new artefact is brewed. The “good luck stone”. \n\n36. Speak to the doctor and choose to save Fly. Go to Fly's body which you passed on the way up to the meet the Black Doctor. Drop the “good luck stone” artefact into the \nanomaly she is lying in. A flash will occur as usual and when the artifact is done cooking Fly will be alive. Talk to her and pick up the cooked artefact “Isomorphic Compass”. Then go talk to Panther who is in the tunnel leading out of the hospital. She is there with her father. Wait until Fly goes down from the top level of the hospital to the ground level of the hospital and she stops. Then head down the tunnel and leave the hospital. \n\n37. We are transferred to Agroprom. Talk to Ghost. \n\n38. We stood and watched the show + in the active SMS dialogue, while the participants of the show does not take away home. \n\n39. Appears Arkhara, talking with him, he leaves. Do not rush anywhere to run, yet he will not leave and not come escha red SMS. You can now turn to the gate we'll see a character talking to who understand what we cooked for authors in the next dope. \n\n40. We go into the teleporter at the gate, look at the last surprise from Arkhara and with a sense of accomplishment go for a walk around and finish what has not been completed yet. The Lightning quests will be available almost right after this scene. Unfortunately, the version with a patch from 20.12 has a bug that prevents to know what should happen with false endings (when the player receives the money and refuses to revive Flies). False endings are very similar to the true, except for a couple of interesting points some will find themselves, everything is clear and understandable. Virtually This is all Taken by me from the dialogue or SMS in the course of the story. ";
	string t_16_LightningquestsandsearchesintheDeadCityLimansk  = "1. This quest starts after step 39 in “Generators or the elusive Astrologer”. After talking with Fang and go into the teleport in Agroprom by Fang. We fall from the sky onto the top of the tower in the Agroprom Loner base. Look around and see another teleport bubble. Jump into it. You will start to receive SMS messages from Lightning. Go to the bar and talk to the technicians in the back room. \n\n2. Wondering who might have placed a bug in our PDA we talk to the technicians in the back of the bar (Associate). There is an SMS message exchange. Lightning is trapped and she doesn't know where she is. She sends you a picture you can view in the active tasks section of your PDA. It is the area between the o-conciousness room and the sarcophagus. You can now go back to these areas from the sarcophagus or CHAES-2. \n\n3. When we get close to the place where we find lightning she will spawn and the task to find lightning will complete. We find Lighting lying on the floor wounded. We give her a medkit and talk to her. She gives us the task to find a stalker in Limansk. A photo of a house is shown in the active tasks section of the PDA. \n\n~Tip: We will need a first aid kit. \n\n4. We go to Limansk and find the house in the picture. On top of the roof there is a teleport bubble we need to go through. Head through the teleport bubble then look for the dead body of her friend. Pick up the note by the dead body (The wander?) and after some messages we are sent back to the house in the picture. We leave the area through another teleport bubble and spawn next to the house. There we meet Semetsky. Kill all nearby Monolith and talk to him. \n\n5. Semetsky tells us to go to the generators and look for a one-legged stalker. A transition from Limansk to the Generators will be on the Limansk map. There is a series of SMS messages with Ghost and he tells us to look for the stalker in a tent in the North West section of the generators map. \n\n6. Find the one- legged stalker (Maximilian). After some SMS messages talk to Maximilian. We get the job to find a teleport bubble in the basement of the Sarcophagus and to photograph Monolith. Then talk to Ghost who should appear in Maximilian's camp. \n\n7. Go to the Sarcophagus and find the teleport bubble and go into it. When we exit the teleport bubble there will be a camera gun, notebook and a third item. The third item is currently invisible in the inventory screen. Then look at the Monolith stone with a pair of binoculars. You should see an invisible wounded Monolith which shows up as a red rectangle with the binoculars. Shoot the area where the invisible wounded Monolith soldier is to successfully take the picture. A photograph will appear at your feet if you have successfully taken the photograph (basically you have shot the invisible wounded monolith soldier to complete the mission). If no photo is at your feet you missed and will need to start again. After picking up the photo you will be transported to the Old Village. \n\n~Tip: Photo appears at your feet, if successful. \n\n8. In the Old Village you will receive some SMS messages. Go to Pilgrim give him the photo and ask him to erase the numbers. \n\n~Tip: Pilgrim takes a long time to edit the photograph. \n\n9. Pilgrim sends you an SMS message to pick up the picture (sometimes you just ask him). Go to the Generators and talk to Maximilian. \n\n10. Give him the photo and he gives you an Advanced Detector (detector isomorphic). There are several SMS messages involving Lightning and Fang. \n\n11. Go to X-10 and go to the position displayed in the active task section of the PDA (It is next to the transition from x-10 to the sarcophagus). You will receive some SMS messages. You are told not to kill the radio operator. Wait a while and a group of invisible npcs will show up escorting a visible npc (the radio operator you are not supposed to kill). Wait for the radio operator to open the coded door then kill everyone but the radio operator. \n\n~Tip: Hiding on the bottom of the ladders going into the holes seems to be the best place to hide. It doesn't seem necessary to have the radio operator open the door before killing the invisible npcs. He can do it afterwords. \n\n\n\n~Tip: There will be no more than to shoot rats on the approach to the room with the breaker switch and in the very room that would be clan fighters last day they are not diverted. \n\n~Tip: Stay hidden until the coded door is opened. \n\n12. Talk to the Radio Operator (Korn) then talk to Fang. Pick the Camera and note up. \n\n~Tip: If Korn is killed/injured during the shoot out reload the game. It may have effects on the games plot line/stability. \n\n~Tip: If possible do without intermediate saves. Otherwise it may possible for quest items to fall into the texture. If this happens, we will leave them in X-10 and we will fail everything . \n\n13. Go to the Nursery school in Pripyat to look for the camera lens in a cache. When you get \nnear the room with the cache a message will be displayed. Open the door and take the lens from the floor, pick up the globe isomorph on the floor and take 3 mines from the backpack. We exchange SMS messages with Fang about the safe we can't open in the room. We meet Korn and Fang some where between the transition from Pripyat to Radar and the Nursery School. \n\n~Tip: killing all the animals and enemy npcs on the way to the Corn’s cache in Pripyat will make it easier to keep him alive later. \n\n14. When Korn gets to the room he approaches the safe and unlocks it. Wait until Fang reaches his final position in a room near the safe. He follows behind Korn at quite a distance and may take a while to reach the room. Then talk to Fang. We get the job to place 3 mines on the floor/stairway. After planting the mines and repelling an attack talk to Fang again and he sends you to the Red Forest. There is also a link listed in the dialogue to Arkharas profile at AMK.ru. \n~Tip: The mines for mining the floor are in the backpack. \n\n15. After having talked to Fang we head to the Red Forest to find the Forester. Talk to the Forester and he will offer you a camera part as a reward for killing a sniper. He tells you to go up the ladder to the top of the Foresters tower. On top of the tower he will send you some SMS messages. Use you binoculars to make the sniper show up as a red rectangle box. Then shoot him. Go back to the Forester and there will be a gun on a table near him. Pick it up then talk to the Forester. The Forester then gives you a photo pistol after taking the camera parts. He also tells you about a body near a camp of Hunters. The hunters camp is through the cave and by the claw like rock formation in the middle of the field where you gave the Hunters a backpack earlier from Mitka the thief. The body is the small hole in the middle of the claw like rock formation. Take everything from the dead body. You will get some SMS messages and after a while a transition from Red Forest to Varlab will appear in a cave by the tank. \n\n16. Go to Varlab and talk to Klenow. Klenow gives us three shots of film for the photo pistol to take two pictures. We can only miss on one shot. Take the isomorph artefact that looks like a potted cactus on the floor by the door. You will need it for these missions. \n\n17. Go to lab X-16 in Yantar and take a picture of the brain. When you get to the top floor of the x-16 brain room take out your binoculars and look for the invisible wounded npc to show up as a red rectangle (its the same as in the sarcophagus) then shoot him with the camera pistol and if successful you will get a message and the photo will appear in your inventory this time. If you are really lucky find the controller somewhere in the game and take its picture. You may need to skip/fail this task and go on to the next step. \n\n~Tip: Aim a little bit high the photo pistol bullets drop a bit at that range. ~Note: In the current version of the mod the controller is hard/impossible to find. There have been reports of it being in the bloodsucker village in the Army Warehouses. Failing this portion of Klenow's task costs you the bonus for the mission. An isomorph artefact. Failing to take the controllers picture seems to have no other effects on the game. \n\n18. Go to the ground level of the Yantar factory. Around the building with the entrance way to x-16 you will find a yellow dot on your minimap. This is Chernomor a friendly zombie you need to talk to. Remove all weapons from your weapon slots and put them in your backpack or the mission will be ruined. Talk to Chernomor and bring him 2 packages of anti \nzombie (antidote) drugs and escort him to the stalker camp across from the Yantar factory gates. When Chernomor takes the anti zombie drugs he and you will become enemies of the zombies again. You will need to kill everything in the Yantar factory area to get Chernomor to move. You can also use weapons now and Chernomor will not become your enemy. Talk to Chernomor and he will tell you he can get information on how to get into the Dead City and that he will contact you later. ~Important Note: Put all weapons into your backpack when any where near any zombies. It will wreck the mission by causing Chernomor and all the other zombies to become your enemy. Making the mission impossible to complete. You can use your knife though. This evil program bug wasted hours, and led to my only failed job (excepting scripted events, like ~Kill Strelock~). \n\n~Tip: I found 3 packages of anti zombie (antidote) at the tunnel under the road in Yantar on the side where Sakharovs bunker is. \n\n19. Go to Varlab. Talk to Klenow and he takes the pictures and the photo pistol. \n\n20. Go to the nuclear power plant and meet Lightning. Talk to her. Throw an isomorph artefact into the anomaly that is in the room with her. Save you game first in case you don't like what you get back from the anomaly. \n\n~Tip: save game before obtaining ~useful things~. You may not want them. \n\n21. Lightning tells us to go to the spot where the holographic doctor appears in the o- consciousness room. Stand in the middle of the bright circle where the hologram was. After some SMS messages you will teleport to the Garbage. We receive some SMS messages from Panther. \n\n22. At he Garbage meet Hoag. In my game he was in the Garbage at the transition from the Garbage to Cordon. Talk to him and help get his stuff back from a Flesh that ate his stuff. The flesh is some where in the Garbage. Kill it and find papers and stuff on its corpse. Hoag tells us about a cache left by people wearing invisible suits. Find the cache and take it. The NPC is not hard to find. He will wave to you when you approach. \n\n23. After helping Hoag we go to the Rookie Village in Cordon. On the way we get some SMS messages from Panther. Go to the rookie Village and talk to Panthers Father. Try to catch up to her and see what happens. Panthers Father returns to the Rookie Village. Speak with him. Exchange SMS with Chernomor a. We speak with maple and it teleports us a note and infected camera. \n\n24. We leave for Yantar, talking with Chernomor. \n\n25. Returning to the Cordon, takes a picture and compute the villain. Speak to him and submit to Panthers Father. \n\n26. We leave on the basis of freedom (Freedoms base ?). Exchange SMS with Panthers Father. Making the shot. Compute a stranger and talk to him. \n\nTip: A good photo gets the message: ~Photo shoot was a success. View photo obtained~. \n\n27. Take masking Ekzu (sneak to?)and move on Undiscovered land(Reconnoitred Earth). Listen in, when the representative of the Last Day will go and talk with Maximilian and get a tip on the hiding-place in the agricultural industry. ! \n\nTip: Despite the fact that the PDA indicated the location of a cache in the attic, look for it should be in the trees, as was indicated in the MLS. \n\n28. Taking the contents of the cache and nominated to Sakharov. Seeing that we brought to him, Sakharov gladly share information on podsmotrennom teleport in the X-16. \n\n29. We go into the Teleport its exit is in the X-16 take all that we find and do as written in the retrieved papers. \n30. Teleport to Yantar, talking with Chernomor. SMS exchange with Lightning. \n\n31. We arrive where Lightning is, throw the portal item in, be sure to collect all that flies back. We say goodbye to Lightning. \n\n32. We find in Limansk teleport, activate it and watch the movie. We are waiting for another continuation.";
